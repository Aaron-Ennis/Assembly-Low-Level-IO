# Low-Level I/O Procedures in IA-32 Assembly

This is my portfolio assignment for **CS 271: Computer Architecture and Assembly Language**

This program implements low-level I/O procdures to collect 10
32-bit signed integers from a user as keyboard string input.
It then validates the input, converts the string input to its
integer value and calculates the sum and average of the values.
Then each entered value, their sum, and their average are
displayed on the screen.
